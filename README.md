# Industrial revoluton tiem ! ;^D

# TODO

* buttons
* css
* historical population and labour figures for the start of the game
    * keep in mind balancing should follow approximately the real trajectories of great britain during the time period 1750-1910
* implement space
* implement cities
    * logistical penalty between cities
    * population density penalty inside cities
    * population density alleviated by better logistical infrastructure inside the cities
* implement disease
* TEXTILES!!!
    * largest industry throughout the industrial revolution
    * figure out how to incentivize the player to produce cheap clothing
    * squalor resource? function of pop density * disease * starvation * all kinds of bad stuff * access to clothing
    * large malus for not producing enough clothing for one person per six months?
* implement starvation (food scarcity) effect on pop growth
* implement logistics
    * transportation equipment
    * managing horse populations should be a pain in the ass to encourage change to mechanized transport
    * some kind of formula that causes people to starve more due to increased prices due to increased size + population density of cities
    * increased shipping and navy production = less logistical malus from importing goods like coal etc.
    * eventually building shipping for importing certain goods will eclipse local production by a wide margin
* implement thirst and hunger
    * implement starvation (food scarcity) effect on pop growth
    * implement beer
    * implement water
    * implement spirits
    * meat
        * every tick, some % of meat is lost to spoilage based on logistics and maybe refrigeration technology
        * cured meat decays at 1/100th the rate of meat
* implement farming
    * seasons and weather
    * one shared "farm" area that represents all farming in the country?
    * farming equipment
    * mechanized equipment
    * specialized to food groups? neglecting farming of a food group leads to malnutrition of the general population but some kinds of food are easier to make and transport than others
    * logistical barriers from farm to city
    * model accurately the transition from an agrarian to an industrial economy. most of the difficulty should be in squeezing 100 extra people into factories from the farms etc
* implement military
    * indented?
    * ships
    * small arms
    * uniforms
    * subsidies
* implement technology
    * first to expand upon
    * technology is "discovered" and then spreads slowly between cities based on literacy, access to books and logistical capability i.e. trains etc
    * implement doctrines
        * doctrines will be ideas that gained popularity throughout the industrial revolution that led to profound societal effects
* implement labour
    * labour will be the primary scarcity throughout the game
    * as shipping increases and colonial holdings increase, shipping can be built and assigned to transporting migrants from other countries to remedy labour shortages
    * encourage 90%-95% employment rate to react to overall population fluctuations
* implement "random" events
    * events that are pseudo-random, such as the country going to war, trade wars with rival economies, absorbtion of nearby dominion etc
* historical considerations
    * "second" and "first" industrial revolutions
    * great britain setting, adjust population etc appropriately
